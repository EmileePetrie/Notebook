--Module 2
-	Britain

-	Name is Thayendanegea
-	Portraits
-	Realize at end the paternalistic attitude of Britain – fought against it

My name is Thayendanegea. I died over two hundred years ago, but I am still remembered today. However, my legacy has been taken out of context. Sometimes I have been seen as an assimilationist or traitor. I want to take some time to contextualize myself.  
I do not want to present myself as good or bad. I am human and make mistakes. I had a lasting impact on the world and whether or not that is good or bad, that is for you to decide. 

Intent. Outcome. Warrior. Church. Statesman. British. 
Triggers: grass, chalkboard, light switch, pencil, etc.
