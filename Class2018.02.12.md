Grading and Module 2
-	Paradata – what you did and why it matters
-	- Process notes are required – if you look at this a week later, can you redo this
- - Build what you’re learning into process notes and paradata
- Active listening and attention in lectures – insofar as the first one, getting full marks because explanation was not clear enough
- - One annotation per article isn’t going to cut it
-- A perfectly valid annotation is: “This phrase is not clear to me. Can someone explain this to me?”
- Make sure to consciously make an effort to tie what you’re doing/seeing to the lectures, to your annotations, to the discussions, etc. 
- Paradata length – must be substantial, not necessarily long but meaningful
- If model never came together in meaningful way, acknowledge that you’d wish you’d done better and start from someone else’s model and connect to their biography
- - Can build on one another’s work 

#### Building Module 2
- MeshMixer works very well
- - Might have to simplify models – makes model easier to work with and mesh
- - - Decimate the mesh
- - - Reduce triangles
- - Look at British Museum and Smithsonian 3D models
- Twitterbot better for Module 3
- Module 2 due before class on the 26th of February


#### Museums and Reproductions
Plaster casts 
- Parthenon frieze casts
- - Used to teach what constitutes good art
- Casts eventually are not enough – falling out of favour because they are becoming too democratic – too many people have them and they have lots of them
- - Less special when everyone can access – devalue 
- - Change to getting the actual thing itself and not casts of itself
- Cast Courts, Great Exhibition 1855
- - Lots of casts, which are enjoyed by lots of ordinary folks 

Industrialization of Academia
- Museums shifting from plaster casts to having the actual objects themselves 

Museo della Civilta’Romana
- Musolini in power, Italy not in existence long
- - create political identity
- museum full of plaster casts – about the context of display, not just the cast
- - idea that they can only have casts because other people have taken the original 

Casts to Cast-offs
- 1870s to 1970s casts are totally out of fashion and museums would get rid of their collections of casts
- 1970s – environmental movements, acid rain – realization that for a lot of historical monuments, that the casts were they only records we had anymore

Problems for museums
- Lighting is deliberate in museums – prevent damage, prevent photography, etc. 
- - Not equipped to deal with the fact that we can go into a museum and create a model
- Will they allow models and modeling?
- - British Museum provides models itself
- Will they allow data to be downloaded?
- Will they allow data to be remixed?
- Will they charge a fee?

What’s the position of Canadian Museums on the creation of models?

Fear of misuse – reputation management and mismanagement 
- If we provide data on artefacts, how can we control what happens to it?
- Maori see messing with the digital version as messing with the physical version
- Answering these questions requires infrastructure concerning: Recording methods and metadata; Digital object discovery and access; Citation of digital objects; Analysis and study; Digital object reuse and repurposing; and The critical role of a national/international digital archive
- - Infrastructure, not just policy – budgets, time, etc.
