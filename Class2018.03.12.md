## Archeogaming with guest lecture from Andrew Reinhard
Videogames – built-heritage 
Archeology of the recent past, of media, etc. 
Any videogame is archeological in nature, doesn’t have to depict history, underlying text is archeological
Broader context, sensorial experience, etc. 
Harris Matrix – How to draw in two dimensions and three-dimensional space – system for making sense of what happened first and what happened last
- Software kind of behaves like the Harris Matrix
Different platforms for same games – how does that change the game?
-	Transferred between consoles or between versions of the game
- -	Universal glitches that everyone knows about – originally a flaw but becomes part of the original game
- -	E.g. processing factor that makes things slower to appear on screen when there is a lot but as you eliminate them, more appear, and it becomes more difficult – processing factor that makes it more difficult the further along the game you get
In archeogaming, must be careful not to bring in colonial package that is very present in archeology 


Think about making a bot that compiles a bunch of historical facts about Brant to create a new narrative and see what comes up
- Present facts about his life in tweet format
- -	E.g. happy Mother’s Day, [his mom’s name]
- -	E.g. met with [someone] today! The meeting went …
- -	E.g. when [artist] paints your portrait… [link picture of his portrait]
