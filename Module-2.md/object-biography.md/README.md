### A Bishop Saint
In June 2015, Geoffrey Marchal created a digital three-dimensional model of the statue called A Bishop Saint. This statue, which depicts an anonymous bishop holding a staff and a bible, was acquired by the National Gallery of Denmark in 1905. The 98-centimeter-tall statue was carved in limewood in the early sixteenth century (Statens Museum for Kunst). Marchal’s model was made with Memento Beta from AutoDesk (Marchal, 2015). 

The statue was created circa 1500 to circa 1515, during the period of iconoclasm that preceded the Protestant Reformation in Europe. Iconoclasm and the Protest Reformation were reactions to the increasing greed and corruption of the Christian Church and its veneration of idols. The Catholic Church responded to these movements by reaffirming “the value of visual representations” (Heal, 2017, p. 247). Neither the National Gallery of Denmark nor Marchal provided much historical information about A Bishop Saint; however, it may be surmised that this statue was part of the Catholic Church based on the destruction of many idols during the period of iconoclasm and on the Catholic Church’s protection of these idols.  


### Remix Model: Bishop Brant
This remixed model combines the body and costume of a bishop with the head of Joseph Brant. This model suggests that Brant was influenced greatly by European culture and Christian religion, more so than the original statue by Marlene Hilton Moore might suggest. 

Elizabeth Hutchinson explains that his self-presentation is “a self-conscious manipulation of contemporary codes of costumes and pose directed toward both Native and non-Native viewers” (2011, p. 213). Brant is most often depicted in Indian dress, which is “a mixture of articles of English and Native origin that was the conventional costume of Native-Anglo trade and diplomacy in the eighteenth century” (Hutchinson, 2011, p. 209).  His self-presentation demonstrates his indigeneity and states his role negotiator and interpreter of cultures. His role as an interpreter in this colonial period meant that he had to understand European culture. His understanding became admiration, which can be seen in his conversion to and promotion of Christianity. However, his role in the Christian community and his promotion of the religion in Mohawk communities is not evident in his appearance. 

This remixed model portrays the importance of Christianity to his legacy. It is not meant to interpret this legacy as having a negative or positive effect on his Indigenous community; it is meant to draw attention to the importance of this legacy and the various narratives attached Brant as a historical figure.
