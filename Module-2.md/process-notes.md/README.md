## Process Notes

### Class on February 5
- what about remixing all the statues and busts from the Valiants Memorial? (search on Sketchfab, look for creative commons licensed stuff)
- Make a separate copy of model explicitly for messing with it

### Class on February 7
- I thought about creating a Twitterbot for Joseph Brant but I decided against it. I thought that it might be problematic because of the racial issues that Indigenous peoples are facing, particularly having their voices taken from them. And because he is a controversial character who can be perceived differently in connection with different ideas, it would be difficult to create a voice for him. 

### Class on February 12
- Can work off someone else’s model – acknowledge that you wish you’d done better and include that model’s biography into your writing
- Can I mesh 3D models and 2D images? 
- - i.e. combine portraits of Joseph Brant with my module to create a coloured more complex 3D model
- What’s the position of Canadian Museums on modelling? – show that are engaging with lectures

### Planning the Digital Thing
- I reviewed the instructions for this model and I decided against my first choice with which I planned to mix my digital object because I thought it would be difficult and unpleasant to create an object biography about the remix. I had created a model of the statue of General Sir Isaac Brock that is part of the Valiants Memorial. I wanted to focus on a part of Brant that was adaptable to different situations. Upon reviewing the object biography, I created for Module 1, I decided to remix my model with European, secular and religious representations.
