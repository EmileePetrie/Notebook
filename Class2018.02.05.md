### Module 2: History is a Remix

** what about remixing all the statues and busts from the Valiants Memorial? (search on Sketchfab, look for creative commons licensed stuff)
Make a separate copy of model explicitly for messing with it


Remixes tell something about the creator and can show something maybe not obvious in the original
- not all remixes are valid or true – sometimes shows too much bias, too much cherry-picking of evidence 

Is it compelling or truthful?

Remixing of plaques made by the Department of Recreation and Conservation
- Original: Fur, Gold, and Cattle: Founded in 1812, Fort Kamloops stood at a natural crossroads. For 50 years it remained the focus of an inland fur empire until the roaring mining boom of the 1860’s. Ranchers, with cattle and horses, replaced the miners. They settled, and stayed, to see two railways bring prosperity anew to this land of sagebrush, sun, and great rivers.
- Remix: Salmon, Copper and Elk: For millennia before European arrival, Tk’emlups was home to a stable and diverse local economy. Secwepemc commercial trade routes, resources and relationships allowed the fur trade to thrive, and Fort Kamploops men survived on meat & fish sold by local harvesters. Ranching, railways and settlers changed the balance: traditional lands were alienated, cattle disease decimated elk populations, & punitive, racist laws denied prosperity to Secwepemc residents. 

Remixing vs. Mixing
- The ‘re’ part is problematic
- A mix brings something new into being, something new from the source materials that was always latent

Deformance  & Interpretation (McGann and Samuels)
- “reading backwards ‘short circuits’ our usual way of reading a text and ‘reinstalls the text – any text, prose or verse – as a performative event, a made thing’ (Samuels & McGann 30). Reading backwards revitalizes a text, revealing its constructedness, its seams, edges, and working parts” – Mark Sample

Deformed Humanities – a humanities born of broken, twisted things. And what is broken and twisted is also beautiful, and a bearer of knowledge. 
- Humpty Dumpty broke and something better came of it 
- “the deformed work is the end, not the means to the end.”
- Deformance vs. deformation 

Topic Models – a way to begin to reshape or remix your historical sensibilities
- Imagine a world were every document can be composed from a bucket of words relating to a specific topic (think of the word fridge magnets) – can devise a program that can look at words in documents and decompose that article back into those original buckets (but you need to know how many buckets there were originally)
- Look at 5 bucket world vs. 100 bucket world to see what happens
- i.e. Topic Model for John Adam’s mind based on his journals – remix made from attaching different instruments to different buckets
