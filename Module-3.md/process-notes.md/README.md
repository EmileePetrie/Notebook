### Critical Making in Digital History – March 12, 2018
Think about making a bot that compiles a bunch of historical facts about Brant to create a new narrative and see what comes up

Present facts about his life in tweet format
-	E.g. happy Mother’s Day, [his mom’s name]
-	E.g. met with [someone] today! The meeting went...
-	E.g. when [artist] paints your portrait… [link picture of his portrait]

### Critical Making in Digital History – March 14, 2018
You are designing a museum. How do you depict Joseph Brant?
-	Do you identify him as Thayendanegea or Joseph Brant? Why?
-	What do you want to say about the community he grew up in?
-	How do you contextualize Brant and his life?
-	What are his greatest accomplishments?
-	Do represent him as a traitor or a sympathizer or as an ambiguous figure?
-	What do you know about him before? What ideas are you trying to challenge?
-	End with a depiction of how you represent him.

### Question ideas
- How does a person compete with the heavy-handed paternalism of colonial settlers who thought Indigenous peoples were savages and less -than themselves?
-	Do you focus on his accomplishments and failure? Do you also talk about his childhood and how he got there? 
-	What do you know about Joseph Brant? What do you want to focus your research on?
-	Decide to omit a lot about Molly Brant, his sister, because she is a complex character that could overrun a summary of his life. 
-	Was leasing land to non-Indigenous settlers a good thing or a bad thing?
-	How do you represent him? Ambiguous figure? Traitor? Hero? Etc.?
-	How much do you focus on the events that happened during Brant’s life time? E.g. collapse of western confederacy
-	Is trying worth the effort of remembering or is it a failure?
-	Should Isaac’s death be omitted or included?

### How did I create the Twine game “Who is he? Joseph Brant / Thayendanegea”?

The first step in the creation of this game was thinking of an idea around which I would base the game. I wanted to create a game wherein the player could interpret information about Brant in order to create a brief biography for him. I established the role of the player as an intern at the Canadian Museum of History (CMH). The goal of the player is to make decisions about how they want to represent Joseph Brant in a short summary of his life for the First Peoples Hall in the CMH. 

I used Twine to create this game, which I titled “Who is he? Joseph Brant / Thayendanegea”. Twine is a program that one can use to create a text-based game online. Users write passages and create options for players to choose within those passage. Each choice or “move” leads the player to another passage with another choice. The program uses a tree diagram to depict the game while one is working on it. Twine allows one to easily create a narrative text-based game. 

To create this game, I drafted questions that I wanted to pose in the game. I then searched my research notes for decisions Brant made that could create context for these questions. I continued to organize my thoughts in this manner until I had all the questions that I wanted. I then wrote several biographies for Brant based on the outcomes of the questions that were posed throughout the game. 

The first two interpretational ideas that I wanted to establish were the name by which the player wanted to identify Brant and the emphasis of their biography. The first question I posed the player was whether they wanted to identify him as Thayendanegea or Joseph Brant. As with all the questions I would ask, I made sure to provide context. Thayendanegea was his traditional name, which he was given at birth, and Joseph Brant was his Christian name, which historian used to identify him. The next question I asked was whether the player wanted to emphasize Brant’s relationship with the Church, his role as a warrior, or his role as a statesman. I wrote a quick biography of Brant that summarized some of his key actions and decisions that had to do with those three emphases. The creation of the rest of the game followed much the same structure: establishing a question, providing context for the question, writing a passage, and pasting the passage in Twine. 

Often, I did not have time to ask as many questions as I wanted to. I wanted to make sure that I had a biography at the end of each branch in the tree diagram. I wrote a lot of biographies about Brant and asking more questions would mean that I would have to write even more biographies. It is not a very long game, but it was a lot of work. 

Although I research Brant for early modules, I focused Module 3 on information I gained from James W. Paxton’s book Joseph Brant and his world: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman (2008).
