### Who is he? Joseph Brant / Thayendanegea
This textual game explores different interpretations of Brant and the decisions that led to those interpretations. Brant is a controversial historical figure. Some people see him an assimilationist, while others see him as a forward thinker. He supported the British in the American Revolution. He was an Anglican who translated sermons into the Mohawk language. He led the Six Nations to a settlement on Grand River, for which he had negotiated with General Haldimand. His actions have been interpreted in a variety of ways depending on how one views the current political climate in Canada between Indigenous peoples and the government. This game looks at how one might understand Brant as the controversial historical figure described in Module 1 and as "Bishop Brant", who was greatly influenced by British culture and religion, described in Module 2. 

“Who is he? Joseph Brant / Thayendanegea” is meant to criticize the choices one makes when interpreting history. The study and representation of history is about choosing what to omit and what to include in the depiction of history. This game allows players to decide what they wish to emphasize and omit in their depiction of Brant and how they wish to interpret his actions. The purpose of this game is not to suggest that one of these interpretations is more correct than another, but to suggest that history is a personal experience. One understands history through the context of one’s own knowledge and one’s experiences.
