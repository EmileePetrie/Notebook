Computational Creativity and the Ontological Meaning of Your Models

Computational Creativity is the study and simulation, by computational means, of behaviour natural and artificial, which would, if observed in humans, be deemed creative. 
- Is there not some sort of humanity in Computational Creativity? There is some kind of meaningful connection to human activity.

Video on basically everything he was talking about with neural networks / machine learning.

Asking if art is good, is the wrong stream of questioning as history students. 
Better questions: What are these things? Why are they the way they are? How did they get this way? What do they mean?
Are we dealing with play, work or labour? Automata, autom???

Technology is terrifying.
 
Entanglement: the way that an object has associations and entangled lines of being with other things
- I.e. iDevices entangled with the working conditions of those who made them - map these entanglements and see how they affect how we tell history, etc.
- “Never a neutral way of using technology, only a mindful way.”

Ontological framework
- Bounded spaces - contain different histories that are equally true -
- Evidence of absences - things that don’t physically exist, but are still meaningful, which only exist because of a bounded object/space

Programming as a form of forgetting










MOUNT VESUSIUS
CE 79, Mount Vesuvius erupts, 4 sequences of collapses and the 4th reached Pompei
	Thermal waves will kill you immediately, but it also makes your muscles contort
	Site buried under several meters of ash
Tunnelling is easier than excavating - tunnel until find something cool and then dig it up and drag it out
Find voids - fill with plaster and remove rock - get casts of furniture - they discover the voids in which a body was once encompassed before it disintegrated
	These first casts were very fragile - we are now making casts of casts, and each time we make a cast, something is lost
3D photogrammetry enters the scene and create pseudomorphs (expressed in the material of something else)

How do we understand the bodies of Pompeii, which are found as voids? Is a cast/pseudomorph a human body?

	Quote from this (^) article, “The kids were the most forthcoming. Many of them rushed up to her, then uttered some variant of "Oooh, uggh! Is that a real Roman?" Their mums and dads tended to improvise one of two fairly predictable responses: "Yes dear, it is, but don't worry - she died a very long time ago"or "No, don't be silly, it's just a model" In an odd way, both those answers turn out to be right.”




 
Forces of things that exist
 

Permeability vs. persistence (forces defining the qualities of the object - resistance to change)

The biography of a victim of the pyroclastic surge - about the quality of the object
- The day before eruption: real human being, with loved ones, vices, etc.
- Eruption happens: the body does not persist very long (is permeable)
- The body decomposes and the stone hardens (which is still permeable, but persists for 2 thousand years) - all that is left is the imprint of the body in the rock
- Void and imprint are different
- Fill void with clay and break the stone away
- Gets these casts - skeuomorphs - simultaneously from the past and from the present
- Have to make molds because they decay - make in new kinds of materials
- Start making 3D models and 3D print those models pseudomorphs - digital form is still permeable (think digital remixes or iOs updates that don’t allow you to access anymore) 

  
When we do archaeology, we are intervening in the things

Enchainment vs. containment (forces defining the processes of assembly/disassembly - how it travels)


So what does this have to do with computational creativity?
- Computer is a prosthesis for thought
- Humanity is not a standard to which we should compare computers and computational creativity
- Think about the edges - of different steps, time, space, and how they smear against each other
- Computation creativity forces us to see things not as bounded but as blurred
- We don’t know what creativity is in humans, so how can we know what it is in computers?
- History asks why. To be able to ask why about these digital things means that we must be able to see the framework. 

What is the ontological meaning of your projects?
- Where is the creativity in your models?
- How do your models fit on these frameworks? Why?
- What do you see when you try to map the moments, the glitches, the voids and spaces?



Digital is only impermeable in certain ways
