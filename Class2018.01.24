as build product, think about authenticity and trust and meaning of anything that gets digitized.
- Trusting the source



Module 1
- 3D object files
- - For purpose of course, create new file in GitHub
- - Files 
- - - File model.obj – geography 
- - - File model.mt – stitch onto geography
- - - File texture1.phg 
- - - File texture2.phg 
- Object biography
- - Why you selected? 
- - Why important historically?
- - Why should care about it?
- - Bibliography file Harvard style 
- Paradata
- - Discussion of what you were trying to data, etc. 
- Process notes
- - Any of the notes you’ve made will making your object are stored here – personal notes
- .Rhistory
- README.md

ACCORD PROJECT

+Thoughts on the heritage of the project:

-How the process changed to the final product. (What they thought/planned vs what came out)
 - Effect of the object on audience interpretation vs how the creators intended it. 

Process vs. product - intangible vs. tangible
-how much of the process does the audience need to know about to create the “proper” context for appreciating the product?

In the process of creating something, does it change the story of the object? And are you indirectly changing the story? How can the change of context or environment change the object and its perceived meaning? 

Divorcing an object from its context 

Why are we reproducing something?

How did the community interact and how did it change them? 
Stated that they weren’t ready to take the most professional and objective picture. Acknowledge own limits. Value was in the process of creating the object and connecting with its heritage. 

Aura - cult of originality for so long, but there was a time when the copy was what was valued (plaster casts of ancient architecture) - where is the aura in both? 
•	Now movement towards valuing the original object without context (simply because it’s the original)
•	Preserving the form but not the material - sometimes the material is just important as the form - the material can inform the form and have its own connotations 

Context of production, display, materials
•	Can be political - will see this later 

Idea of performance

Artistic value vs. historical value
•	Artistic - its ability to inspire future work, change doesn’t diminish the object’s value
•	Does intent behind the creation of the model influence the end value in some way? From a artistic or a historic perspective. 
•	Is historical value performed as well as artistic value?

Continually remaking an object for the needs of the present

In digitizing things do we lose the sense of the tangible - does it lose meaning?
- Google Maps/Earth - captures a moment in time (weird temporality) 
- Google Earth Project on residential schools in Canada - showing the schools and their role https://earth.google.com/web/@43.127456,-80.240846,200.63860771a,4500000d,35y,0h,45t,0r/data=CmYSZBIgYTBlNWFkNDVhMjBiMTFlN2IzZmQzZjBhY2YwNDZiOWEaHkNhbmFkYeKAmXMgUmVzaWRlbnRpYWwgU2Nob29scyIgZWZlZWRfcmNnc19yZXNpZGVudGlhbF9zY2hvb2xzXzA 
<b> I posted the article on the residential schools because the talk about digitizing things and how it captures a moment in time reminded me of this article I'd read earlier that talked about this project. The project shows Canada's residential schools on Google Earth and provides some facts about the schools. </b>
  
Do you have to go to a place to find meaning with it?
- What insights a feeling of connection to a digital thing? (changes meaning of the thing)

Think about aura, meaning, trust, authenticity of anything that gets digitized 
- What does digitizing do to the history?



Top Tips of 3D Models
- Using computers is easier than your phone
- - Underhill computers or Regard 3D (at home)
- - There are more settings you can play with when using the computer
- Make sure to get rid of the background of your pictures  (photo-masking)
- - Use paint and erase background
- Gimp is a free ”photoshop” that will allow you to remove the background 
- - Trace with a select tool and then inverse, and delete
- -  The cleaner your image, the better your model
- Use highest resolution image possible 
- Work with it and see what you can do, the more work you can get done in Regard3D is less work for you when it comes to editing.
- Great lighting
- 30-50 pictures and angle is important
- DON’T feel discouraged the first time you do it because it probably won’t work (but that’s okay!!)
- Watch Tutorials
- Possibility: try taking video and taking stills from video (youtube-dl, ffmepg, exiftool)
- Work is parts, it helps prevent breakage.

3D modelling applications
-Gimp
-vectr
-photoshop (there are tutorials on how to get all adobe applications for free just google it)
- MS paint
-SketchUp (no download needed for the free version)
-exiftool (to add focal length for pictures taken on phone camera apps)

Uploading Your File to Github 

Model.obj (mathematical description)
Model.mtl (textual data)		------> ALL 4 ARE NEEDED FOR YOUR MODEL
Texture1.png
Texture1.png

Put all of the files in a Zipfile and upload to Sketchfab, if you want the public to be able to see your model
