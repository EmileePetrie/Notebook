My name is Neggen Aoghyatonghsera of the Oneida Nation. I was the first wife of Thayendanegea, more commonly known as Joseph Brant (1743-1807). We were married from 1765 until my death in 1771. 

You might call me a ghost and, in a sense, that is what I am. I am a spirit. I am not here to haunt you. I am here to clarify a few misconceptions about my husband. Above all, he was a man, neither good nor bad. I do not wish to interpret his actions and his legacy for you; however, I do wish to make it clear that you must think critically when you judge him who lived over two hundred years ago. 

I have left notes in several books in the MacOdrum Library at Carleton University. Since I lack a physical form, you will have to access my notes through your phone.

Thayendanegea is controversial as a historical figure. He was a Mohawk warrior and statesman. He supported the British during the American Revolution. He fought for land and land rights for the Iroquois following their loss in the war. He is controversial because of his participation in both Indigenous and European cultures. He is sometimes seen as an assimilationist and sometimes as a forward thinker. His legacy is open to interpretation.

In order to understand Thayendanegea, one must understand his people and his culture. Thayendanegea was a Mohawk from modern day Ohio. He was, what people in the twenty-first century, would call Indigenous.  

Indigenous peoples became Indigenous through colonialism. This is not how we identified ourselves prior to contact with Europeans. Before, we identified ourselves by our nations and people. However, European settlers differentiated us from them and homogenized all peoples living in North America prior to their arrival by calling us “Indians”. The origin of this mythologizing, homogenizing and othering identity is this man here: Christopher Columbus. It is important that we recognize that the narrative created by Columbus – in which Indigenous peoples are savages, wild, uncivilized and inferior – is incorrect.

Thayendanegea was never a Mohawk chief. He had political influence amongst the Mohawk people and other Iroquoian peoples and he was given the title of captain by the British, but he was never a chief. This is a popular misconception.

I would like to address how Thayendanegea is described here: as a “monster”. This is an opinion shaped by colonial attitudes of dehumanizing Indigenous peoples. I think it is important to remind you of two things: (1) Thayendanegea was human, and (2) this was a war. His actions were neither good nor bad; they were actions. It is your prerogative to interpret his actions and decide whether you value outcomes or intentions more. However, I urge you to remember that “right” and “wrong” are subjective concepts.

Here is a portrait of Thayendanegea, painted by George Romney in 1776. It is important to remember that Thayendanegea was Mohawk. He has been whitewashed in some representations of him. There has also been some speculation as to whether or not he was half white; he was not.

I hope I have clarified some misconceptions about Brant. His legacy is still open to interpretation, but it is important that you interpret his actions with a solid foundation of knowledge about him. I encourage you to think critically.
