## Rubric

I propose a rubric that divides the twenty points allocated to Module 4 between the readings, drawing on the class discussions, the product itself, the process notes and drawing on past modules. I propose that 3 points are for the readings, 4 points are for drawing from class discussions, 6 points are for the product itself, 5 points are for process notes, and two points are for connecting themes throughout all the modules. 


### My reasoning

Much of my proposed rubric and my reasoning is the same from Module 3.

I think the integration of the class discussions and readings in the context of the object were more important than the annotations themselves. Therefore, I decreased the value of the annotations to three points. There were also fewer classes and, therefore, fewer readings to be completed for Module 4 so I decreased the value of the integration of course materials to four points. 

I increased the points dedicated to the object itself to six points because of the complexity of Module 4. I used a lot of tools and programs that I had never used before and had no idea how to use. 

I added the section for drawing on the past modules because I feel that it is important that the modules are connected by more than just being about the same artefact. They should have some of the same themes so that I can discuss what has changed and what has stayed the same in the final project. 

I kept the same value of the process notes, which is five points, because of the time that went into creating this module. The creation of Module 4 was not very straightforward.
