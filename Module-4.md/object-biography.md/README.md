### NeggenAndThayendanegea

*Neggen and Thayendanegea* is an Augmented Reality that explores different secondary sources from which one can learn about Joseph Brant. This narrative comments on five books found in the MacOdrum Library at Carleton University. 

The augmented reality is dictated by Neggen Aoghyatonghsera, Brant’s first wife. She was called Peggie; Brant’s biographer Isabel Thompson Kelsay (1984, p. 99) speculates that she was christened Margaret. Neggen was an Oneida girl from Oquaga. Neggen and Brant “married on Monday, July 22, 1765” (Kelsay, 1984, p. 109). They were married until Neggen died in 1771 of consumption (Kelsay, 1984, p. 133). Brant would remarry twice. 

This Augmented Reality is a continuation of the analysis of Brant’s legacy and the promotion of critical thinking found in the Twine game “Who is he? Thayendanegea / Joseph Brant”. 

*Neggen and Thayendanegea* encourages its audience to think critically when reading different sources and when interpreting Brant’s legacy. This Augmented Reality is meant to promote critical historical thought and analysis.
