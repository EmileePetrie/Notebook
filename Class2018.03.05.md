## Authenticity and ‘Historical’ Video Games
Reverse gears from last class – it’s all about representation, graphics, etc. – not mechanics

Kingdom Come: Deliverance video game
-	Othering of non-white mercenary armies, etc. 

Programming is about forgetting – what stays in and what stays out 
-	Retelling history is always about what you highlight – what is given weight and what is omitted entirely 
-	What warrants representation?

What does authenticity look like to Kingdom Come: Deliverance?
-	Only interaction with women you can have is to rape them
-	Can’t play as a woman because “authenticity”
-	No people of colour
-	Realistic because there is no magic
-	Footnote fetish
-	Wrong plumage on chickens
-	Realistic because
- -	Tent pegs
- -	How you hold your sword
- - Racism / misogyny 
- -	Etc.
Europe was huge melting pot and it was not uncommon to find people of colour in archival records
What kind of past do audiences want to remember?
-	Gay characters cast as villains
-	Anyone who is different is clearly cast, depicted, etc. as “other”
-	In line with modern Czech Republic 
- -	Represent elements historical Czech to make an argument about current Czech Republic

Questions of representation to think about when you play a ‘historical’ game: 
-	Who is the villain?
-	Who is the hero?
-	Who matters to the story?
-	Who is left out?

Interrogate the silences – the omittances 

Questions of mechanics to think about
-	Are these actions reasonable in the context of this era?
-	Are these actions meaningful within the context of the game (do they carry consequences)?
- -	Mechanics matter in what they permit the player to do – actions must have consequences

Counterfactual - relating to or expressing what has not happened or is not the case 
Games are just a system of interactions, and those interactions matter to the player and to the game – figure out the meaning of those interactions

The graphics don’t matter a damn bit
-	Graphics get in the way and make it difficult to discuss the representation of the past
-	Market the graphics, talk about how the visuals represent the past, not the interactions
-	Maybe graphics are important for emotional value – historians are good at taking the personal connections and emotions out of narratives


### CRITICAL PLAY
What kinds of authenticity are at play?
Path of Honours

Focus on military
Little discussion of family and women
Would like more context for choices
-	What is the average age for these accomplishments?
-	What do the omens mean? They did not seem affect my play
-	Do I have to serve my campaigns consecutively? 
Destory History
