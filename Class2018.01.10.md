### My Entry Ticket: 
- "Unfortunately, she knows enough about the strange customs of restorers and curators to bow to the fact that this is, indeed, the original although only in name, that the real original has been irreversibly lost and that it has been substituted by what most people like in a copy" 
- by Bruno Latour and Adam Lowe's "The migration of the aura or how to explore the original through its fac simile."


<b>Note: </b> I am more likely to contribute to the contribute to the collaborative notes than to take my own notes on Github. Therefore, I have pasted the collaborative notes below. My contribution to the discussion included talking about the "original" and its relation to the painting in which the whale was found when someone was trying to restore the painting. 


“If we stop interpreting, if we stop rehearsing, if we stop reproducing, the very existence of the original is at stake. It might stop having abundant copies and slowly disappear.” 
-what about those people who cannot visit Paris every day to visit the Louvre?
-what about authenticity? Who is looking for authenticity?
-collective memory
-but without these copies, would we value the original as much?

What does originality mean?

“The original although only in the name”

The value of replications..
Why are these objects replicated? 

 The “secondary”
 
  
Which one is the reproduction?^
Which one is more valuable?

Subjectivity, reproductions with small defects are worth more than the original(ex: star wars figures, rare coins, stamps, defect bank notes)

Mechanical reproduction of art gives more access to the masses. Original vs. cheap reproduction. An artist’s intention of their piece loses meaning as time goes on. The audience may perceive the piece of art entirely different than the artist or fellow audience members.  

Censorship in restoring original paintings. 

 The public is an examiner, but an absent-minded one.

Objects have a use biography - used and represented different ways throughout its life.
