# Process Notes

I tended not to take too many notes because I was outside while working scanning the statue and wanted to have my hands out in the cold for the shortest amount of time. I commited most things that I wanted to note into my memory and saved it for the paradata document. 

### Notes I took after visiting the Canadian Museum of Heritage where I first tried to create a model:
- had difficulty using app when lighting was too low
- consistently found gaps in digital copies - will need to be steadier and take more photos

### Notes I took while trying to create the model in Regard 3D:
(These notes were used to track what I had done so that it could be included in my paradata)
- edit on gimp
- figure out Exiftool
- export all on gimp
- redo with png

### Notes I took while reflecting on the readings and their relation to my project:
Benjamin
- wonder about what is lost in translating Brant (the human) into statue - talking about presence in time and space
- is the original Brant of the statue for my model?

Reilly
- Brant is fleeting (Permeable and Momentary)
- portraits of Brant are also fleeting, though more persistent than Brant
- statue is enduring (persistent and impermeable) although not completely

Latour and Lowe
- what does the original mean for a person?
- everyone knows not original, but can it be in its own form?
- statue resembles portraits
