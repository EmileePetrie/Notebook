# Process Notes

I did not take many notes throughout the process of creating my 3D model, instead commiting my observations to memory.

## Notes I took after visiting the Canadian Museum of Heritage where I first tried to create a model:
- had difficulty using app when lighting was too low
- consistently found gaps in digital copies - will need to be steadier and take more photos

## Notes I took will trying to create the model in Regard 3D:
(These notes were used to track what I had done so that it could be included in my paradata)
- figure out Exiftool
- export all on gimp
- redo with png
