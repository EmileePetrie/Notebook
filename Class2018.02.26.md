### Module 3: digital things to digital words
Create an immersive experience – augmented reality, virtual reality, creation of a world, twitterbot, twine, etc.
Twine – write out the text and the choices, etc. 


### Visual Worlds of the Past: an intro to games/history
Human tells stories and weave those stories into the landscape – the experience of those landscapes really depend on the stories we tell

### Lecture
Chris Crawford – one of the first and biggest names in video games
-	“Games are… the most ancient and time-honored vehicle for education. They are the original educational technology, the natural one, having received the seal of approval of natural selection.”
-	Games are models of external situations – not real
-	Interaction must be meaningful – player must be able to influence the world
-	Conflict – there must be a goal, something to overcome
-	Safety – the game space is safe in that it allows you to complete the full consequences of the game without an in-real-life threat 
Prior to Columbine massacre, literature talked of games as positive educational tools
Video games can be ethical if the actions have real consequences 
MDA Model Three dimensions to measure a game along (Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, Robert Zubeck): mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics
-	Mechanics – basic rules of code
-	Dynamics – the emergent play out of the mechanics
-	Aesthetics – the lessons derived from the dynamics
Historians care about video games because the give a way to move away from the question of what happened toward the question of why it happened
-	Contingency – the way things unfurled and why it happened and not some other way
-	Equa-finality – given a set of circumstances, all are equally probable and only one set outcome – difficult to make causal argument 
-	That immersive experience changes how you engage with the source material in the first place
Play games to find out what happened net – historians want to know what would have happened if _
-	What happened then?
-	Why did it happen?
-	To play a game successfully, the gamer has to learn why things happen the way they do in order to win
-	To be a successful historian, the historian has to learn why things happened the way they did
Simulations are not an oracle, they are interpretations
-	Interpretations that require further historical questions
Procedural literacy and procedural rhetoric
-	Building the argument at the level of the mechanics
-	Procedural rhetoric will be the hard part – spend a lot of time in paradata thinking

Ludology: the study of games. Also: the study of games as a unique field, especially as distinct from narrative.
-	Ludus – rule-based games 
-	Paidea – free form games
Narratology: the study of storytelling; the study of games as story systems

 

Alternate reality games
-	Perhaps the best mode for the historian?
-	Ergodic texts – come from the great first struggle, a path that you struggle, must to work to understand – meaning of an ergodic text only comes through experience 
-	Includes series of transmedia puzzles and challenges to move the story forward
The value of ARGs for historians
-	Immersive, authentic experience
-	Have to think like a historian to succeed
-	Allows multiple viewpoints, inhabit multiple viewpoints
-	Emergent meaning making
https://fielddaylab.org/make/aris/ - make a ARG – works best on iDevices
-	Probably better for Module 4

Don’t get distracted by the graphics while creating a digital world. Focus on the mechanics.
