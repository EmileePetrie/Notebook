### Module 4
Aurasma is now HP Reveal 
-	Platform for making augmented reality
-	Can define a trigger and can associate that trigger with a sound clip, a video, etc. 
Aris
3D print and create pop-up museum
Maybe explore this as unseated Algonquin territory or explore campus and find tweets and then discuss whether they are real or not in augmented reality

Videogames drawing on own universe and our universe – multiplicity of context in a game
Put a lot of weight on games – critical thinking required to realize what is real or not 
Realism – cannot represent all of life, but can represent part of it 

### Rubric
What do you want your Module 3 to be graded upon? Upon which framework to you want your Module to be graded?
Grade your work when you hand it in and show why based on the criteria. 

TRADITIONAL: 20 points. 5 for the readings. 5 for how you draw on what we’ve done in class. 5 for the thing itself. 5 for process notes. 

Show that you have developed a rubric that highlights the essential things you want your work to be graded against. You have to justify that rubric. 
-	Active / passive narration
-	Rules > representation
-	Emergence of meaning through movement
-	Historical contingency = process = mechanics
-	Games on a continuum to simulations
-	Layered meanings
-	Context

MINE: 3 for the readings. 5 for drawing on class. 6 for the thing itself. 6 for process notes.
Making notes on the readings are not as important as being able to draw from the discussions and readings. The thing itself took a lot of thought, lot of conceptual thought to figure out the rules. Process notes and paradata and important for review and to see why you’ve done something. 
I struggled with the readings because I am not familiar with videogames. 
Points for greater context for all modules?

DIY rubric
-	Degree the object challenges the human, fosters engagement
-	Effort to importance ratio
-	Reuse to new material ratio (this time, there’s a lot more new stuff)
-	Engagement with key themes – engagement with theme X; engagement with theme Y etc. 
-	Keep paradata and process notes – how you’re doing X; why you’re doing X
-	Proof of engagement with reading materials / lectures / discussion
o	Proof of engagement is in paradata
-	The thing itself: 

### Module 3 
You are designing a museum. How do you depict Joseph Brant?
-	Do you identify him as Thayendanegea or Joseph Brant? Why?
-	What do you want to say about the community he grew up in?
-	How do you contextualize Brant and his life?
-	What are his greatest accomplishments?
-	Do represent him as a traitor or a sympathizer or as an ambiguous figure?
-	What do you know about him before? What ideas are you trying to challenge?
-	End with a depiction of how you represent him.

You work at the Canadian Museum of History. You are charged with writing a passage about Thayendanegea / Joseph Brant for the First Peoples Hall. You are not very familiar with this historical figure, although you have heard of him before. You know his is a famous Mohawk who played an important role in the American Revolution. You know he interacted a lot with the colonial settlers and his historical importance has a great deal to do with his relationship with settlers. 
First you must decide how you wish to identify this historical figure. Do you identify him as Thayendanegea (Joseph Brant) because this is his traditional name and it fits with the context of the exhibit? Do you identify him as Joseph Brant (Thayendanegea) because this is how he has been identified in the prime and important events in his life and this is how he is most commonly known?
You read about Joseph Brant in James W. Paxton’s book “Joseph Brant and his world: 18th Century Mohawk Warrior and Statesman.” You know more about Thayendanegea / Joseph Brant than you did before. 
The discipline of history is about choosing what to omit and include in the representation of an event or historical figure. You must now choose what you want to emphasize most about Thayendanegea / Brant’s life. 
What do you know about Joseph Brant? What do you want to focus your research on?
You find out a fact. How much importance to you weigh that fact?
Done some great things in his life. Which do you want to focus on?
How do you represent him? Ambiguous figure? Traitor? Hero? Etc.?
